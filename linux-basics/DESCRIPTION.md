This module will teach you the basics of using Linux, specifically on the **command line**.
The **command line** (also called the terminal or shell) is a way to control your computer by typing instructions instead of clicking on buttons.
You type a command, press Enter, and the computer follows your instructions â€” like opening a file, moving something, or searching for a word. It might look plain, but it's a powerful tool!
